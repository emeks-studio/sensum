## [sensum](https://sensum.emeks.com.ar)

An anonymously way of express your sensations through a decentralized network, power by open source code and blockchain technologies. For more details about the project please visit and read our [wiki page](https://github.com/emeks-studio/sensum/wiki).

**NOTICE**: Since we recently achieve decentralization, `sensum` can be considered as an historical name. Now we usually refer to the project as `d-sensum` or `dsensum`.

### Repositories

- **[sensum-landing](https://gitlab.com/emeks/sensum)**\

Plenty of poetry and philosophical views are presented by the developers 
throughout the project's [lore](https://emeks.gitlab.io/sensum/lore/).

- **sensum-ethereum**\
Contains Ethereum smart contracts and scripts that allow a decentralized version of `sensum`.

  * Wiki ref: Conjurer and Channel stuff lives here

- **sensum-pwa**\
The module contains the code for the progressive dapp (PWA + Web3) that allows users to interact with the `d-sensum` network via a UI that can be access in several ways and equipments.

- **[dsensum](https://github.com/emeks-studio/dsensum)**\
For easy access, the deployed dapp it is available as a Github page hosted at https://emeks-studio.github.io/dsensum/.

  * TODO: Link (and create hehe) a documentation where we describe other ways to access the dapp (like IPFS, or as a self hosted web app).
