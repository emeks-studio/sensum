## [sensum](https://sensum.emeks.com.ar)

sensum is an open and anonymous network that allows electrons to express 
themselves by transmitting their sensations through the current each time 
The Oracle randomly designates one of them as the new _chosen one_.\
Sesations are carried to every electron, yet no one can know where they echo from.

### Repositories

- **sensum-mobile**\
Mobile app built in [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) which currently 
serves as the main UI for the sensum project.

- **sensum-ethereum**\
Proof of concept and first attempt to decentralize sensum through the use of 
the blockchain.\
For more info refer to [this issue](https://github.com/emeks-studio/sensum/issues/32).

- **sensum-backend**\
_Unavailable for technical reasons._\
Hosted by a bunch of _granujas_, this flawed backend tries to preserve the 
frail heart of The Oracle, which painlessly dwells in a place full of 
randomness and mystery. 

- **[sensum-website](https://gitlab.com/emeks/sensum)**\
Considered by many as the entry point to the sensum universe.\
Plenty of poetry and philosophical views are presented by the developers 
throughout the project's [logbook](https://emeks.gitlab.io/sensum/lore/).

### Collaborations

Some electrons are not only part of the network, but also decide to escape 
their own orbital to help shape the project as a whole.\
We thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

- **[sensum-telgram-bot](https://github.com/ariedro/sensumbot)**\
A bot capable of always fetching the latest sensation available from the 
sensum network and share it in a telegram chat or group.
