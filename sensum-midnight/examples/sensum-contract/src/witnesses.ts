 * The only hidden state needed by the bulletin board contract is
 * the user's secret key.  Some of the library code and
 * compiler-generated code is parameterized by the type of our
 * private state, so we define a type for it and a function to
 * make an object of that type.

//   // EXERCISE 1b: INITIALIZE THE OBJECT OF TYPE BBoardPrivateState

/* **********************************************************************
 * The witnesses object for the bulletin board contract is an object
 * with a field for each witness function, mapping the name of the function
 * to its implementation.
 *
 * The implementation of each function always takes as its first argument
 * a value of type WitnessContext<L, PS>, where L is the ledger object type
 * that corresponds to the ledger declaration in the Compact code, and PS
 *  is the private state type, like BBoardPrivateState defined above.
 *
 * A WitnessContext has three
 * fields:
 *  - ledger: T
 *  - privateState: PS
 *  - contractAddress: string
 *
 * The other arguments (after the first) to each witness function
 * correspond to the ones declared in Compact for the witness function.
 * The function's return value is a tuple of the new private state and
 * the declared return value.  In this case, that's a BBoardPrivateState
 * and a Uint8Array (because the contract declared a return value of Bytes[32],
 * and that's a Uint8Array in TypeScript).
 *
 * The local_secret_key witness does not need the ledger or contractAddress
 * from the WitnessContext, so it uses the parameter notation that puts
 * only the binding for the privateState in scope.
